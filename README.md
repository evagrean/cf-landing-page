# CF Landing Page

This is the current state of my project after ~3 hours of work.

## If I had more time to work on this project ...

* It would have implemented a better design and layout
* I would have displayed the total price in the correct currency based on user's location 
* I would have conducted tests
* I would have deployed the frontend to gh-pages, Netlify or sth. similar

## Further Comments

It was a totally new experience for me to have a relatively short time slot to build a project from scratch. I started to build the main functionality as making GET requests and displaying the corresponding data. Getting the geolocation via another API I postponed because I had to first familiarize myself with the implementation (but wanted to have the basics already up and running). This holds also true for a clean styling.

## Thank you
Thank you for this challenge. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them at any time.
